# The VBA of Wall Street

1.	Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.<br>
* The ticker symbol.<br>
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.<br>
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.<br>
* The total stock volume of the stock.<br>

2.	Conditional formatting highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red.<br>
3.	Your solution will also be able to return "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". <br>
4.	Make the adjustments to allow it to run on every worksheet (every year), just by running the VBA script once.<br>
 
## Deliverables
